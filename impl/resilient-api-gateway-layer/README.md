# Resilient API Gateway Layer

A Go-based API gateway that implements enterprise-grade resilience patterns to
protect downstream services from cascading failures. The gateway acts as an
**Ambassador** proxy that offloads cross-cutting concerns — circuit breaking,
bulkhead isolation, retry with backoff, and timeout management — from both the
client and the upstream services.

## Architecture Overview

See [diagrams/architecture.md](diagrams/architecture.md) for the full
high-level architecture diagram.

## Resilience Patterns

This project implements four interconnected resilience patterns. The execution
order matters — each layer protects against a different failure mode.

See [diagrams/pattern-interaction.md](diagrams/pattern-interaction.md) for the
full pattern interaction diagram.

### 1. Ambassador Pattern

The gateway acts as a client-side ambassador proxy. All outbound calls to
upstream services pass through a single controlled path that handles:

- Request logging with structured fields
- Correlation ID (`X-Request-ID`) generation and propagation
- Service name header injection (`X-Service-Name`)
- Deadline propagation (`X-Request-Timeout`)
- Response normalization and error sanitization

### 2. Bulkhead Pattern

Isolates concurrent connections per upstream service using a semaphore-based
pool. Prevents one slow or overloaded service from exhausting gateway
resources.

See [diagrams/bulkhead-pattern.md](diagrams/bulkhead-pattern.md) for details.

- **Per-service isolation** — each upstream gets its own connection pool
- **Queue with timeout** — requests wait up to `queue_timeout` (default 500ms)
  for a slot before being rejected
- **Fail-fast rejection** — returns `CAPACITY_EXCEEDED` immediately when pool
  is saturated

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern

Stops calling a failing upstream service to give it time to recover, instead
of continuously hammering it with requests.

See [diagrams/circuit-breaker-state.md](diagrams/circuit-breaker-state.md) for
the full state machine diagram.

- **CLOSED** — normal operation, requests flow through, failures are counted
- **OPEN** — failure threshold exceeded, all requests rejected immediately
  (fail-fast)
- **HALF-OPEN** — after cooldown expires, allows a single probe request to
  test recovery

The circuit breaker is implemented as a finite state machine (`FSM`) with
explicit transition rules. See `pkg/fsm.go` for the FSM engine and
`pkg/circuit-breaker.go` for the circuit breaker logic.

### 4. Retry Pattern

Automatically retries failed requests with exponential backoff and jitter for
transient failures. Key behaviors:

See [diagrams/retry-timeout-flow.md](diagrams/retry-timeout-flow.md) for the
full retry and timeout strategy diagram.

- **Idempotency-aware** — only retries `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`,
  `OPTIONS`; immediately aborts on timeout for `POST` and `PATCH`
- **TCP timeout abort** — TCP connection timeouts are not retried (indicates
  network-level issue, not transient)
- **Exponential backoff with jitter** — `backoff = min(30, 1 << attempt)`
  with random jitter to prevent thundering herd
- **Request deadline** — overall wall-clock limit (default 60s) that caps
  total time including all retries and backoff waits
- **5xx immediate trip** — upstream 5xx, 401, or 403 responses immediately
  force the circuit breaker open without retry

See [diagrams/error-handling.md](diagrams/error-handling.md) for the full
error handling flow.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | Gateway listen port | `6969` |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `dev` for text logs, `prod` for JSON logs | `dev` |

### Service Configuration (config.yaml)

```yaml
services:
  web-backend:
    host: web-backend_devcontainer-app-1
    port: 8080
    timeout: 5            # Circuit breaker cooldown (seconds)
    threshold: 5          # Failure threshold to trip circuit + max retries
    max_connections: 10   # Bulkhead concurrent connection limit
    queue_timeout: 500    # Bulkhead queue wait timeout (milliseconds)
    request_deadline: 60  # Overall request deadline (seconds)
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `host` | Upstream service hostname |
| `port` | Upstream service port |
| `timeout` | Circuit breaker cooldown duration before transitioning to HALF-OPEN |
| `threshold` | Number of failures before circuit opens; also used as max retry count |
| `max_connections` | Maximum concurrent connections in the bulkhead pool |
| `queue_timeout` | Maximum time to wait for a bulkhead slot (ms) |
| `request_deadline` | Wall-clock timeout for the entire request including retries (s) |

## Timeout Hierarchy

Three layers of timeout ensure no request hangs indefinitely:

| Timeout | Duration | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Queue Timeout** | 500ms | Wait for bulkhead slot |
| **Connection Timeout** | 5s | TCP dial per attempt |
| **Response Timeout** | 10s | Response header per attempt |
| **Request Deadline** | 60s | Total wall-clock including all retries |

## Testing

See [diagrams/testing-strategy.md](diagrams/testing-strategy.md) for the full
testing strategy diagram.

Tests use Go's built-in `testing` package with
[testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) assertions. Integration tests
use `net/http/httptest` to spin up fake upstream servers with configurable
behavior.

### Run All Tests

```bash
cd services/ambassador
go test ./... -v
```

### Test Suite Overview

| Test File | Type | Tests | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pkg/fsm_test.go` | Unit | 2 | FSM valid and invalid transitions |
| `pkg/circuit-breaker_test.go` | Unit | 4 | Closed → Open → Half-Open → Closed lifecycle |
| `pkg/bulkhead_test.go` | Unit | 2 | Pool capacity and active connection tracking |
| `services/call_test.go` | Integration | 4 | Full request flow through all resilience layers |

### Integration Test Scenarios

| Test | Scenario | Validates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TestCallService_CircuitOpensOn500` | Upstream returns 500 | Circuit immediately trips to OPEN on 5xx |
| `TestCallService_TimeoutTriggersRetry` | Upstream hangs (15s) | Retries up to threshold, returns `TIMEOUT` |
| `TestCallService_CircuitHalfOpenThenClosedOnRecovery` | Upstream recovers | HALF-OPEN probe succeeds → circuit closes |
| `TestCallService_BulkheadRejectsWhenPoolFull` | Concurrent load (5 reqs, pool=2) | Excess requests get `CAPACITY_EXCEEDED` |

### Test Infrastructure

- **`testEnv` struct** — encapsulates logger, managers, service, and fake server
  port for each test
- **`setupTestEnv(t, handler)`** — creates an `httptest.Server` with a custom
  handler, registers a `"test"` service in config, and wires up fresh bulkhead
  and circuit breaker instances
- **`newTestRequest()`** — builds a standard `CallRequest` targeting the
  `"test"` service

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
```

### Run the Gateway

```bash
cd services/ambassador
cp .env.example .env
go run main.go
```

### Run the Backend

```bash
cd services/web-backend
go run main.go
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6969/call \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "target_service_name": "web-backend",
    "method": "GET",
    "url": "/api/v1/products"
  }'
```

### Check Gateway Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:6969/status
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Bulkhead before Circuit Breaker** — resource protection takes priority over
  failure detection. A saturated bulkhead rejects before checking circuit state.
- **Circuit Breaker before Retry** — fail-fast prevents wasted retry attempts
  when the circuit is already open.
- **Retry is idempotency-safe** — non-idempotent methods (`POST`, `PATCH`) are
  never retried on timeout to prevent duplicate side effects.
- **5xx immediately trips the circuit** — upstream server errors, auth failures
  (401, 403) force the circuit open without waiting for the failure threshold,
  since these indicate a known-downstream problem.
- **4xx does not affect circuit state** — client errors (400, 404) are passed
  through without counting as failures, since they are not indicators of
  upstream health.
- **TCP timeouts are not retried** — a TCP connection timeout indicates a
  network-level issue, not a transient application failure.
- **Error responses are sanitized** — upstream error details are never leaked
  to the client. All responses use the gateway error format with a
  `request_id` for tracing.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go
- **HTTP Framework:** Gin
- **Logging:** Logrus (structured logging, dev/prod formatters)
- **Resilience:** Custom implementations (no external resilience library)
- **Testing:** testify (assertions), net/http/httptest (fake servers)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Docker Compose)
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
